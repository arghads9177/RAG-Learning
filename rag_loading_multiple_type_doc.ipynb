       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'rag_docs/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.\\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.\\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.\\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.\\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.\\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people.\\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.\\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.\\n\\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.\\n\\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.\\n\\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.\\n\\nThey keep moving.\\n\\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.\\n\\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.\\n\\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\\n\\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\\n\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.\\n\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\\n\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.\\n\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\\n\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.\\n\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.\\n\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.\\n\\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.\\n\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.\\n\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.\\n\\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.\\n\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.\\n\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\\n\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\\n\\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.\\n\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\\n\\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value.\\n\\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.\\n\\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.\\n\\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.\\n\\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.\\n\\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\\n\\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\\n\\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.\\n\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.\\n\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\\n\\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.\\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.\\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\\n\\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.\\n\\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.\\n\\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\\n\\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.\\n\\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.\\n\\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.\\n\\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\\n\\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced.\\n\\nThe pandemic has been punishing.\\n\\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.\\n\\nI understand.\\n\\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it.\\n\\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\\n\\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.\\n\\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\\n\\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.\\n\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance.\\n\\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room.\\n\\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind.\\n\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.\\n\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year than ever before in the history of America.\\n\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.\\n\\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.\\n\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\\n\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\\n\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.\\n\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.\\n\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.\\n\\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.\\n\\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that.\\n\\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history.\\n\\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen.\\n\\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks.\\n\\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade.\\n\\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.\\n\\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people.\\n\\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America.\\n\\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\\n\\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities.\\n\\n4,000 projects have already been announced.\\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\\n\\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs.\\n\\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure.\\n\\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses.\\n\\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it.\\n\\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.\\n\\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors.\\n\\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\\n\\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it.\\n\\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\\n\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\\n\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”.\\n\\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs.\\n\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives.\\n\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent.\\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning.\\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.\\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history.\\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.\\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.\\n\\nAnd we will really take off.\\n\\nAnd Intel is not alone.\\n\\nThere’s something happening in America.\\n\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story.\\n\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.\\n\\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.\\n\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.\\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”\\n\\nIt’s time.\\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.\\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories.\\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.\\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.\\n\\nLook at cars.\\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up.\\n\\nSo—we have a choice.\\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation.\\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages.\\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America.\\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America.\\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America.\\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\\n\\nI call it building a better America.\\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan:\\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.\\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.\\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.\\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be.\\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.\\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.\\n\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\\n\\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\\n\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.\\n\\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.\\n\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.\\n\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work.\\n\\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.\\n\\nAll of these will lower costs.\\n\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.\\n\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.\\n\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share.\\n\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.\\n\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\\n\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\\n\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.\\n\\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families.\\n\\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\\n\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\\n\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.\\n\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.\\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.\\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\\n\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.\\n\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition.\\n\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism.\\n\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.\\n\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.\\n\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America.\\n\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\\n\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\\n\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.\\n\\nThat ends on my watch.\\n\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.\\n\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees.\\n\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.\\n\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\\n\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\\n\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.\\n\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\\n\\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\\n\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.\\n\\nBut I also know this.\\n\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\\n\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.\\n\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines.\\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.\\n\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.\\n\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19.\\n\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard.\\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.\\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children.\\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do.\\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.\\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.\\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.\\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week.\\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants.\\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.\\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.\\n\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.\\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.\\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks.\\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money.\\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request.\\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.\\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.\\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation.\\n\\nAnd we won’t stop.\\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.\\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.\\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.\\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old.\\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22.\\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.\\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time.\\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.\\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.\\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.\\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced.\\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?\\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued.\\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault.\\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.\\n\\nWe cannot let this happen.\\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.\\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.\\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.\\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours.\\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do.\\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.\\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.\\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.\\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.\\n\\nThird, support our veterans.\\n\\nVeterans are the best of us.\\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\\n\\nI know.\\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.\\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.\\n\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\\n\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\\n\\nHe was born a soldier.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their perfor- mance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research prob- lems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non- parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl- edge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down- sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,\\n\\n34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.\\n\\nDefine(cid:3)\"middle(cid:3)ea(cid:85)\"(x)\\n\\nQ(cid:88)e(cid:86)(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81) A(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:90)e(cid:85)i(cid:81)g: Q(cid:88)e(cid:86)(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81) Q(cid:88)e(cid:85)(cid:92)\\n\\nBa(cid:85)ack(cid:3)Obama(cid:3)(cid:90)a(cid:86) bo(cid:85)n(cid:3)in(cid:3)Ha(cid:90)aii.(x)\\n\\nQ(cid:88)e(cid:85)(cid:92) E(cid:81)c(cid:82)de(cid:85)\\n\\n(cid:84)((cid:91))\\n\\nEnd-to-End Backprop through (cid:84) and(cid:172)pθ\\n\\nRe(cid:87)(cid:85)ie(cid:89)e(cid:85) (cid:83)η (N(cid:82)(cid:81)-Pa(cid:85)a(cid:80)e(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)c)\\n\\nD(cid:82)c(cid:88)me(cid:81)(cid:87) I(cid:81)de(cid:91)\\n\\nd((cid:93))\\n\\nz4\\n\\nGene(cid:85)a(cid:87)o(cid:85)(cid:172)(cid:83)(cid:1121) (Pa(cid:85)a(cid:80)e(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)c)\\n\\nThe(cid:3)middle(cid:3)ea(cid:85)(cid:3)incl(cid:88)de(cid:86) (cid:87)he(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:92)mpanic(cid:3)ca(cid:89)i(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)and (cid:87)he(cid:3)(cid:87)h(cid:85)ee(cid:3)o(cid:86)(cid:86)icle(cid:86).(cid:3)(cid:3)(y)\\n\\nQ(cid:88)e(cid:86)(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81) A(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:90)e(cid:85)i(cid:81)g: A(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:90)e(cid:85) Ge(cid:81)e(cid:85)a(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81)\\n\\n(cid:86)(cid:88)ppo(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(y)\\n\\nFac(cid:87) Ve(cid:85)i(cid:192)ca(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81): Fac(cid:87) Q(cid:88)e(cid:85)(cid:92)\\n\\nz2\\n\\nz3\\n\\nMa(cid:85)gin- ali(cid:93)e\\n\\nFac(cid:87) Ve(cid:85)i(cid:192)ca(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81): Labe(cid:79) Ge(cid:81)e(cid:85)a(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81)\\n\\nThe(cid:3)Di(cid:89)ine Comed(cid:92)(cid:3)(x)\\n\\nJe(cid:82)(cid:83)a(cid:85)d(cid:92) Q(cid:88)e(cid:86)(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81) Ge(cid:81)e(cid:85)a(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81): A(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:90)e(cid:85) Q(cid:88)e(cid:85)(cid:92)\\n\\n(cid:84)\\n\\nMIPS\\n\\nz1\\n\\npθ\\n\\nThi(cid:86)(cid:3)14(cid:87)h(cid:3)cen(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:90)o(cid:85)k i(cid:86)(cid:3)di(cid:89)ided(cid:3)in(cid:87)o(cid:3)3 (cid:86)ec(cid:87)ion(cid:86):(cid:3)\"Infe(cid:85)no\", \"P(cid:88)(cid:85)ga(cid:87)o(cid:85)io\"(cid:3)& \"Pa(cid:85)adi(cid:86)o\"(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(y)\\n\\nQ(cid:88)e(cid:86)(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81) Ge(cid:81)e(cid:85)a(cid:87)i(cid:82)(cid:81)\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of our approach. We combine a pre-trained retriever (Query Encoder + Document Index) with a pre-trained seq2seq model (Generator) and ﬁne-tune end-to-end. For query x, we use Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we treat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\n\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\n\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG can be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\n\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric memory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stack- augmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training.\\n\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera- tion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being extractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches. For knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question generation, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n\\n2 Methods\\n\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models x) with parameters ⌘ that returns (top-K truncated) leverage two components: (i) a retriever p⌘(z 1) parametrized distributions over text passages given a query x and (ii) a generator p✓(yi|\\n\\n|\\n\\nx,z,y1:i\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform- ers Library [66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/ examples/rag/. An interactive demo of RAG models can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/\\n\\n2\\n\\nby ✓ that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i input x and a retrieved passage z.\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n1 tokens y1:i\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n1, the original\\n\\nTo train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p⌘ and p✓ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n\\n2.1 Models\\n\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\n\\n|\\n\\nN\\n\\npRAG-Sequence(y\\n\\n|\\n\\nx)\\n\\n⇡ top-k(p( Xz 2\\n\\np⌘(z x))\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\nx)p✓(y\\n\\n|\\n\\nx,z) =\\n\\ntop-k(p( Xz 2\\n\\np⌘(z x))\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\nx)\\n\\ni Y\\n\\np✓(yi|\\n\\nx,z,y1:i\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n1)\\n\\nIn the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each RAG-Token Model target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\n\\nN\\n\\npRAG-Token(y\\n\\n|\\n\\nx)\\n\\n⇡\\n\\ni Y\\n\\ntop-k(p( Xz 2\\n\\n|\\n\\nx))\\n\\np⌘(z\\n\\n|\\n\\nx)p✓(yi|\\n\\nx,zi,y1:i\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n1)\\n\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\n\\nThe retrieval component p⌘(z\\n\\n|\\n\\nx) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\n\\np⌘(z\\n\\nx)\\n\\nexp\\n\\nd(z)>q(x)\\n\\nd(z) = BERTd(z), q(x) = BERTq(x)\\n\\n|\\n\\n/\\n\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8], and q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating top-k(p⌘( x), is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\nx)), the list of k documents z with highest prior probability p⌘(z\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\n\\n1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use The generator component p✓(yi| BART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input x with the retrieved content z when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters ✓ as the parametric memory henceforth. 2.4 Training\\n\\nx,z,y1:i\\n\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved.

Updating the document encoder BERTd during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20]. We do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERTq and the BART generator.\\n\\nlogp(yj|\\n\\nj \\x00\\n\\nP\\n\\n2.5 Decoding\\n\\nAt test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate argmaxy p(y\\n\\nRAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq genera- tor with transition probability: p0✓(yi| 1) To 1) = decode, we can plug p0✓(yi| RAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood p(y x) does not break into a conventional per- token likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for 1). This yields a set of hypotheses each document z, scoring each hypothesis using p✓(yi| Y , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability of an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with p⌘(z x) and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding, output sequences, 0 where y was not generated during beam x,zi) we can make a further approximation that p✓(y search from x,zi.

For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top k documents for each query. We consider k for training and set k for test time using dev 5,10 } data. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n\\n2{\\n\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\n\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y) and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\n\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x00\\n\\n|\\n\\nx).\\n\\nMSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as “What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\n\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen- eration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions. Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\n\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n\\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\n\\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with claim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore two variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way (supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\n\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA tasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines the generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of \"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross- encoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\n\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu- ments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n\\n5\\n\\nTable 1: Open-Domain QA Test Scores.

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%.\\n\\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is impressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to generate the reference answer, (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and (iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than BART generations (see §4.5).\\n\\n4.3\\n\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\n\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. Table 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual than RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and BART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more speciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\n\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows an example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The Sun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is generated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens. This observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc documents. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We ﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The Sun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun Also Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly, BART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A with \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows how parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n\\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\n\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of state-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and substantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n\\n6\\n\\nDocument 1: his works are considered classics of American literature ...

RAG achieves an accuracy within 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence. We also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved by RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n\\n4.5 Additional Results\\n\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding [33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are more diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing any diversity-promoting decoding.\\n\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. We compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(z x). Table 6 show the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\n\\n|\\n\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5] Wikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer index from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed between these dates and use a template “Who is {position}?” (e.g. “Who is the President of Peru?”)\\n\\n7\\n\\nTable 4: Human assessments for the Jeopardy Question Generation Task.\\n\\nTable 5: Ratio of distinct to total tri-grams for generation tasks.\\n\\nFactuality\\n\\nSpeciﬁcity\\n\\nMSMARCO\\n\\nJeopardy QGen\\n\\nBART better RAG better Both good Both poor No majority\\n\\n7.1% 42.7% 11.7% 17.7% 20.8%\\n\\n16.8% 37.4% 11.8% 6.9% 20.1%\\n\\nGold BART RAG-Token RAG-Seq.\\n\\n89.6% 70.7% 77.8% 83.5%\\n\\n90.0% 32.4% 46.8% 53.8%\\n\\nTable 6: Ablations on the dev set.

RAG answers 70% correctly using the 2016 index for 2016 world leaders and 68% using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders. Accuracy with mismatched indices is low (12% with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, 4% with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders). This shows we can update RAG’s world knowledge by simply replacing its non-parametric memory.\\n\\nEffect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signiﬁcant differences in performance between them. We have the ﬂexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves Open-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved documents. Figure 3 (right) shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher Rouge-L for RAG-Token at the expense of Bleu-1, but the effect is less pronounced for RAG-Sequence.\\n\\nh c t a M\\n\\nt c a x E Q N\\n\\n44\\n\\n43\\n\\n42\\n\\n41\\n\\n40\\n\\n39\\n\\nRAG-Tok RAG-Seq\\n\\nK @\\n\\nl l a c e R r e w s n A Q N\\n\\n80\\n\\n70\\n\\n60\\n\\n50\\n\\n40\\n\\nRAG-Tok RAG-Seq Fixed DPR BM25\\n\\ne r o c s L - e g u o R / 1 - u e l B\\n\\n56\\n\\n54\\n\\n52\\n\\n50\\n\\n48\\n\\nRAG-Tok R-L RAG-Tok B-1 RAG-Seq R-L RAG-Seq B-1\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\nK Retrieved Docs\\n\\nK Retrieved Docs\\n\\nK Retrieved Docs\\n\\nFigure 3: Left: NQ performance as more documents are retrieved.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29], fact checking [56], fact completion [48], long-form question answering [12], Wikipedia article generation [36], dialogue [41, 65, 9, 13], translation [17], and language modeling [19, 27]. Our work uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\\n\\n8\\n\\nGeneral-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench- marks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\n\\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering, using search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture can be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\n\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings [9, 13] or, closer to our work, over retrieved text directly [15]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index.\\n\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including Machine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work.\\n\\n6 Discussion\\n\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks.\\n\\n9\\n\\nBroader Impact\\n\\nThis work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs.\\n\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against misleading content and automated spam/phishing.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this paper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

Identifies Variability in the Data\\n\\n🔹 What It Means:\\n\\nDispersion tells us how much the values in a dataset differ from the average or central value (mean/median).\\n\\n🔹 Why It's Useful:\\n\\nTwo datasets can have the same mean but behave very differently. Dispersion highlights this variability.\\n\\n🔹 Real-Life Example:\\n\\n🎓 Student Test Scores:\\n\\nClass A scores: 70, 72, 71, 69, 70\\n\\nClass B scores: 50, 90, 40, 100, 70\\n\\nBoth may have a similar average (mean ≈ 70)\\n\\nBut Class A has low dispersion → students are consistent\\n\\nClass B has high dispersion → performance varies widely\\n\\n🧠 Insight: In education, dispersion helps identify whether teaching is equally effective for all students or only a few.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is Dispersion Important?\\n\\n✅ 2. Helps Compare Consistency Across Datasets\\n\\n🔹 What It Means:\\n\\nDispersion allows us to determine which dataset is more stable or reliable.\\n\\n🔹 Why It's Useful:\\n\\nIn business and science, we often choose the option with less variability for predictability and control.\\n\\n🔹 Real-Life Example:\\n\\n🚚 Delivery Times of Two Couriers:\\n\\nCourier X: Delivery times (in days): 2, 2, 3, 3, 2\\n\\nCourier Y: Delivery times: 1, 5, 2, 6, 3\\n\\nMean delivery time may be same (≈ 2.5 days)\\n\\nBut Courier X has lower standard deviation → more consistent\\n\\nCourier Y is unpredictable, sometimes fast, sometimes delayed\\n\\n🧠 Insight: Businesses prefer suppliers with lower dispersion for consistent performance.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is Dispersion Important?\\n\\n✅ 3. Useful for Risk Analysis in Business, Finance, Healthcare, etc.\\n\\n🔹 What It Means:\\n\\nDispersion helps measure risk or uncertainty. Higher variability usually means greater risk.\\n\\n🔹 Why It's Useful:\\n\\nOrganizations rely on dispersion to make informed decisions, manage risks, and allocate resources.\\n\\n🔹 Real-Life Examples:\\n\\n💼 Finance:\\n\\nTwo mutual funds have the same average return (10%), but:\\n\\nFund A: Std. Dev. = 2%\\n\\nFund B: Std. Dev. = 8%\\n\\nFund B is riskier due to higher volatility in returns.\\n\\n🧠 Insight: Investors use standard deviation to assess risk.\\n\\n\\n\\nRange\\n\\nDefinition:\\x0b The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\\n\\nFormula:\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nSet: 40, 50, 60, 70, 80\\n\\nRange= 80 - 40 = 40\\n\\n\\n\\nVariance\\n\\nDefinition:\\n\\nVariance is a number that tells us how spread out the values in a data set are from the mean (average). It shows whether the numbers are close to the average or far away from it.\\n\\nIf the variance is small, it means most numbers are close to the mean. If the variance is large, it means the numbers are spread out more widely.\\n\\nA higher variance indicates greater variability, meaning the data is spread, while a lower variance suggests the data points are closer to the mean.\\n\\nFormula (Population):\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFormula (Sample):\\n\\n\\n\\nVariance\\n\\n\\n\\nVariance\\n\\nExample: Find the Sample variance of the data {4, 6, 8, 10}\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nMean = (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 4 = 7\\n\\nVariance = (9 + 1 + 1 + 9) / (4-1) = 20/3 = 6.67\\n\\nThus, the variance of the data is 6.67\\n\\n4 (4 - 7)2 9 6 (6 - 7)2 1 8 (8 - 7)2 1 10 (10 - 7)2 9\\n\\n\\n\\nStandard Deviation\\n\\nDefinition:\\x0b The square root of the variance.

It helps understand how a particular value compares to the rest of the data.\\n\\nIn simple words, percentiles are a way to express the relative standing of a value within a dataset, indicating what percentage of the data falls below that value.\\n\\nFor example, if you scored in the 90th percentile on a standardized test, it means you performed better than 90% of the people who took the test.\\n\\n\\n\\nPercentile\\n\\nTo find the value corresponding to a specific percentile, the following formula is used:\\n\\nPercentile(x) = (Number of values fall under 'x'/total number of values) × 100\\x0bP = (n/N) × 100\\n\\nWhere, \\n\\nP is the percentile,\\n\\nn - Number of values below 'x',\\n\\nN - Total count of population.\\n\\nNote: First we need to sort the data/population before starting the process.\\n\\n\\n\\nPercentile\\n\\nQuestion 1: What is the percentile value for the score 80 for the given population: 50, 100, 70, 80, 56, 60, 80, 75?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nThe given data is not sorted. So first sort the data in ascending order.\\n\\nSorted data: 50, 56, 60, 70, 75, 80, 80, 100\\n\\nNumber of values fall under 80 (n) = 5\\n\\nTotal count of values (N) = 8\\x0bPercentile = (n/N) × 100\\x0b= (5/8) × 100\\x0b= 62.5\\n\\nThe percentile of value 80 for the given population is 62.5\\n\\n\\n\\nPercentile\\n\\nHow to Calculate Percentile\\n\\nArrange n number of data points in ascending order: x1, x2, x3, ... xn\\n\\nCalculate the rank r for the percentile p you want to find: r = (p/100) * (n - 1) + 1\\n\\nIf r is an integer then the data value at location r, xr, is the percentile p: p = xr\\n\\nIf r is not an integer, p is interpolated using ri, the integer part of r, and rf, the fractional part of r:\\x0bp = xri + rf * (xri+1 - xri)\\n\\n\\n\\nPercentile\\n\\nQuestion 3: What is the 15th percentile for the given population of weights of persons 50, 55, 40, 60, 100, 95, 90, 60, 80, 75?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nThe given data is not sorted. So first sort the data in ascending order.\\n\\nSorted data: 40, 50, 55, 60, 60, 75, 80, 90, 95, 100\\n\\n\\tr = (p/100) * (n - 1) + 1\\n\\n  = (15/100) * (10 - 1) + 1\\n\\n  = 0.15 * 9 + 1\\n\\n  = 2.35 \\n\\nAs the r is not integer,\\n\\n\\tp = xri + rf * (xri+1 - xri)\\n\\n\\t   = 50 + .35 *(55 - 50)\\n\\n\\t   = 51.75\\n\\n\\n\\nClass Activities\\n\\nQuestion 1: What is the percentile value for the score 95 for the given population: 50, 55, 40, 60, 100, 95, 90, 60, 80, 75?\\n\\nQuestion 2: Determine the 90th percentile for the dataset below: {3, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50}.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuartile\\n\\nQuartiles divide a data set into four equal parts, each containing 25% of the data. They help to understand the spread and center of the data. As an important concept in statistics, quartiles are used to analyze large data sets by highlighting values near the middle. This method is particularly useful for identifying outliers and comparing different data sets.\\n\\nThere are three quartiles:\\n\\n\\n\\nQuartile\\n\\nLower or First Quartile (Q1)\\n\\nQuartile 1 lies between the starting term and the middle term.\\n\\nThis is the median of the lower half of the data set.\\n\\nIt is also known as the 25th percentile because it marks the point where 25% of the data is below it.\\n\\nMedian or Second Quartile (Q2)\\n\\nQuartile 2 lies between the starting terms and the last terms, i.e., the Middle term.\\n\\nThis is the median of the entire data set.\\n\\nIt is also known as the 50th percentile, as it divides the data into two halves.\\n\\nUpper or Third Quartile\\n\\nQuartile 3 lies between quartile 2 and the last term.\\n\\nThis is the median of the upper half of the data set.\\n\\nIt is also known as the 75th percentile because it marks the point where 75% of the data is below it.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuartile\\n\\nFor Example: Find the Q1, Q2, and Q3 of the given dataset: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 3, 1, 1, 11.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nArrange the dataset in ascending or descending order, depending on your preference. We will arrange the data in ascending order: 1, 3, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 11\\n\\n1st Quartile(Q1) = 25th Percentile = 3\\n\\n2nd Quartile(Q2) = 50th Percentile = 7\\n\\n3rd Quartile(Q3) = 75th Percentile = 10\\n\\n\\n\\nInterquartile Range(IQR)\\n\\nInterquartile Range\\n\\nInterquartile Range is the distance between the first quartile and the third quartile. It is also known as a mid-spread. It helps us to calculate variation for the data, which is divided into quartiles. The formula for calculating the Interquartile range is given by,\\n\\nInterquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1\\n\\nWhere, \\n\\nQ3 is the third/upper quartile, and \\n\\nQ1 is the first/lower quartile.\\n\\n\\n\\nBox Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)\\n\\nA box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of data that summarizes the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It visually displays the central tendency, spread, and potential outliers of a dataset. The shape of the boxplot shows how the data is distributed and it also shows any outliers.\\n\\n\\n\\nBox Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)\\n\\nMathematical Example:\\x0bLet's consider a dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\n\\n1. Five-Number Summary:\\n\\nMinimum = 1\\n\\nQ1 = 3\\n\\nMedian = (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5\\n\\nQ3 = 8\\n\\nMaximum = 10\\n\\n\\t2. Find IQR, Lower Extreme and Upper Extreme\\n\\nIQR =(Q3 -Q1) = 8 - 3 = 5\\n\\nLE = Q1 - 1.5 x IQR = 3 - 1.5 x 5 = -4.5\\n\\nRE = Q3 + 1.5 x IQR = 8 + 1.5 x 5 = 15.5\\n\\n\\n\\nClass Activities\\n\\nExam Scores Analysis\\n\\nProblem Statement:\\n\\nThe following are the exam scores of 11 students in a math test:\\n\\n42, 50, 51, 55, 59, 60, 64, 67, 70, 75, 78\\n\\nTasks:\\n\\nFind Q1 and Q3.\\n\\nCalculate the Interquartile Range (IQR).\\n\\nDetermine if there are any outliers using 1.5 × IQR rule.\\n\\nDraw a Box Plot \\n\\n\\n\\nThank You\")]"

       "'Dispersion is important because it helps identify variability in the data, allowing for a deeper understanding of how spread out or scattered the data values are around a central value. It helps compare consistency across datasets, indicating which dataset is more stable or reliable. In business and science, choosing the option with less variability is preferred for predictability and control. Dispersion is useful for risk analysis in various fields like business, finance, and healthcare as it helps measure risk or uncertainty, with higher variability usually signifying greater risk. Organizations rely on dispersion to make informed decisions, manage risks, and allocate resources effectively. Businesses prefer suppliers with lower dispersion for consistent performance, highlighting the practical importance of understanding dispersion. In finance, investors use standard deviation to assess risk, with variations in returns indicating the level of volatility in investments. Essentially, dispersion plays a crucial role in understanding data variability, consistency, and risk assessment across different industries.'"
